      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I am a Student at BYU-I and I work with computers and robots. I am building a website to help others learn about how to get started with coding and technology. 
        How much do you know about starting to work with robotics and coding? 
        My website will help anyone who wants to start coding and working with technology by having walkthroughs of small simple projects that can be done at home.
        I will be working with each project and present my progress and struggles with each project. I hope that by seeing someone work though tough and struggle will help others have the motivation to finish their projects and be able to learn. 
        How interested would you be in this?
        </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This website is meant to be a sort of portfolio for all my electronic and robotic projects. The people who will be looking at this website will be a mix of professionals looking to see my work and other people looking for tutorials. Based off the people who I am targeting they will most likely be looking at my website on a laptop or desktop computer. The people who look at my website will want to see professionalism and quickly be able to determine by the front-page wither or not the website is up to their standards. </p>  <!-- change this -->

        Hello I am Tucker!

        I am a student at Brigham Young University-Idaho studding Computer Information Technology. Originally from Oregon I love the mountains and getting to those hard-to-reach views. I spend my free time working on my electronics projects or outside with my family. 

        I Love working on small electronic and coding projects. I hope that I can help others start exploring these aeras. I Believe that to make progress that you need to experiment and make mistakes. Donâ€™t be afraid to make mistakes of your own and learn. 

        I will be graduating in July 2023 and am excited to start working in the cyber security field.
